Cirql is a modern social media and communication platform designed for Gen Z, millennials, creators, and tech-savvy professionals to connect and stay informed. It aims to be a friendly, trustworthy, and tech-forward space, offering a user experience that's clean, minimal, and intuitive.

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Core Concepts

The development of Cirql is guided by the following principles, inspired by its [Logo Design Brief](./Cirql_Logo_Design_Brief.txt):

*   **Connection & Community:** Facilitating seamless user connections and the formation of 'loops' or groups for shared interests and discussions.
*   **Modern & Minimal UI/UX:** A clean, intuitive interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, leveraging modern UI components.
*   **Trust & Presence:** Building a trustworthy platform where users feel connected and aware of their network's activity.

## Tech Stack & Key Decisions

*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI Components:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - A collection of re-usable UI components.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (as `shadcn/ui` is built on top of it)
*   **Font:** [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) (via `next/font`)
*   **Database:** To be decided.
*   **Authentication:** To be decided.
