        To provide a seamless experience, the application will automatically take you back to the last page you were on. You can also see a &lsquo;Quick Access&rsquo; list of your most visited pages on your dashboard for easy navigation.

        By default, your basic profile is visible to other users in public directories. However, you can make your account private at any time in your <Link href="/settings" className="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/80">Account Settings</Link>, which will remove you from public listings.
