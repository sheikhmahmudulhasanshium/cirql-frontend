Changelog - v1.3.0 (In Progress)
This version introduces new roles and dedicated tooling for testers, laying the groundwork for more robust quality assurance and user feedback cycles.
‚ú® New Features
Dedicated Tester Panel & Role
What it is: A new Tester role has been added to the system. Users with this role now see a dedicated "Tester Panel" instead of the standard user dashboard. This panel includes an admin-like sidebar for easy navigation.
Why it matters: This provides a centralized and extensible space for quality assurance. Testers can now easily access specialized tools without cluttering the main user or admin interfaces.
Details:
The panel features a dashboard with infographics summarizing a tester's submitted tickets (Total, Open, Pending, Closed) and a chart visualizing these statuses.
A new "My Bug Reports" view allows testers to see a filterable and sortable list of all tickets they have submitted.
A specialized "Report an Issue" modal allows testers to submit well-formatted bug reports to the existing support system with zero backend changes.
