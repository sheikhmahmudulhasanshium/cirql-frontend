To successfully restart your UploadThing integration mission for your Next.js app with frontend and backend separated (e.g., hosted on Vercel), here is a clear, comprehensive prompt to guide your fresh implementation—covering system architecture, best practices, "what not to do," and an actionable to-do list:

## Prompt for Redoing Your UploadThing Integration in Next.js (Frontend + Backend)

### System Overview

- **Frontend: Next.js app** for user interactions, inputs, and triggering file uploads.
- **Backend: Next.js API routes (deployed separately)** to handle authenticated upload sessions, webhooks, and post-upload processing.
- **UploadThing** handles file storage management and provides upload APIs and webhooks.

### Core Requirements

- Support **local files and external URLs (including base64 images)** upload in a unified UI.
- Support **multiple files and multiple URLs at once.**
- Pass **JWT tokens for auth** in upload requests.
- Uploads are sent to UploadThing endpoint, which calls backend webhook after upload.
- Backend webhook must be **publicly accessible** and **unauthenticated**.
- Uploaded file metadata saved in backend MongoDB, categorized by file type to folders like:
  - `media/photo/xyz.png`
  - `media/audio/xyz.mp3`
  - `media/video/xyz.mp4`
  - `media/document/xyz.pdf`
- Frontend and backend repos deploy separately; webhook URL in UploadThing must point to **public backend API URL**, not localhost.
- Proper type handling—map UploadThing upload response to your `UploadedFileResponse` interface before passing data around.
- Use a **universal uploader component** that encompasses local files + URLs + multiple inputs + authentication.

### What Not To Do

- Do NOT use `localhost` or any private IP in UploadThing webhook URLs.
- Do NOT require authorization/authentication on the webhook endpoint called by UploadThing server.
- Do NOT skip mapping UploadThing's upload response to your expected typed interface.
- Avoid sending mismatched file counts or uploading files that exceed your backend route config.
- Do NOT mix responsibilities: UploadThing webhook API route must only handle callbacks, no auth middleware.
- Avoid incomplete error handling or warning suppressions that hide critical upload flow errors.
- Avoid duplicating separate upload components for URL and file when a universal uploader can unify features.
- Don't hardcode input context like `ticketId`; keep it optional and flexible for reuse.

### Step-by-Step To-Do List

#### Backend

1. Create a Next.js **API route** `/api/uploadthing` that exports UploadThing route handler.
2. Define a **FileRouter** with properly restricted file types and optional input, supporting `ticketId`, `groupId`, etc.
3. Write **auth middleware** that *only* protects upload middleware but **NOT webhook POST requests**.
4. In the backend webhook handler:
   - Accept unauthenticated POST requests from UploadThing.
   - Respond with HTTP 200 for successful callbacks.
   - Parse uploaded file metadata and save to MongoDB `/media` collection/document including categorization.
5. Ensure your backend deploys publicly (e.g., Vercel), with environment variables properly set (`JWT_SECRET`, etc.).
6. Verify webhook URL in UploadThing dashboard points to your public backend API (e.g., `https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/uploadthing`).

#### Frontend

1. Build/Use a **UniversalUploader React component**:
   - Accepts multiple local files + multiple URLs/base64 data inputs.
   - Converts URLs/base64 to `File` objects before uploading.
   - Uploads all files in one batch with JWT Authorization header.
   - Accepts optional `input` prop for metadata (e.g., `{ ticketId }`)—kept optional.
   - Properly maps upload response to `UploadedFileResponse[]`.
   - Captures upload state, handles errors, shows user feedback with `toast`.
2. Pass JWT tokens obtained from your AuthContext/store into the upload headers.
3. Replace legacy `FileUpload` and `UrlUploader` components with the UniversalUploader.
4. Use your UniversalUploader anywhere files need uploading: support tickets, social conversation, profile media, etc.
5. Validate URLs/Base64 strings on client-side before uploading.
6. Provide UI controls to add/remove multiple URLs, clear selected files, and initiate upload.
7. Make sure the upload button is disabled when no files/URLs are selected or when uploading is in progress.

#### Verifications and Testing

- Locally test upload flow using **ngrok** or similar, exposing your backend webhook to the internet.
- Use `curl` to test webhook endpoint accessibility and simulate UploadThing POST.
- Deploy backend on Vercel and update the UploadThing webhook URL accordingly.
- Monitor for upload errors like "FileCountMismatch," "Unauthorized," or webhook callback failures.
- Confirm files appear saved in MongoDB with proper folder tags for media type.
- Check type correctness and ESLint compliance with no unused vars or mismatches.

### Bonus (Optional Enhancements)

- Add progress bars or file preview thumbnails in the universal uploader UI.
- Group uploads by media type to assign different folder paths on backend.
- Automate syncing environment variables between repos.
- Integrate error monitoring and logging for backend upload flow.
- Implement upload retry mechanisms and optimistic UI updates.

This prompt covers your system's **flow, architecture, do's and don'ts, and a structured plan to follow** with clear guidance on frontend/backend division and deployment realities.

If you follow this approach, starting fresh and implementing according to this checklist will greatly increase your chance of a smooth, maintainable file upload system with UploadThing in Next.js.

If you want, I can also generate a minimal starter upload example repo skeleton for you based on this prompt!
the upload system is total failure. we will skip this for now.
