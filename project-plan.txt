Changelog - v1.3.0 (In Progress)
This version introduces new roles and dedicated tooling for testers, alongside significant user experience enhancements like smart navigation, laying the groundwork for more robust quality assurance and a more personalized user journey.
‚ú® New Features
Smart Navigation System
What it is: The application now intelligently tracks user navigation to provide two key enhancements: "Resume Session" and "Quick Access Shortcuts".
Why it matters: This makes the platform feel more personal and efficient. Users can seamlessly pick up where they left off, and frequent destinations are just a click away, reducing friction and improving workflow.
Details:
Resume Session: Upon logging in, users are now automatically redirected to the last page they were on during their previous session, instead of always defaulting to the home page.
Quick Access Shortcuts: A new "Quick Access" card on the user dashboard displays a personalized list of the top 5 most frequently visited pages, providing one-click access to their favorite parts of the app.
This is all powered by a new backend activity logging system that securely tracks page views per user.
Affected Files:
Backend:
src/activity/schemas/activity-log.schema.ts (Added PAGE_VIEW action)
src/activity/activity.service.ts (Added getNavigationStats logic)
src/activity/activity.controller.ts (Added new endpoints)
src/activity/dto/ (New DTO files for the feature)
Frontend:
components/providers/AuthInitializer.tsx (Updated login logic to use lastVisitedUrl)
components/hooks/activity/usePageLogger.ts (New)
components/hooks/activity/useNavigationStats.ts (New)
app/(routes)/home/user/user/Shortcuts.tsx (New UI component)
app/(routes)/home/user/user/dashboard-home.tsx (Integrated shortcuts)
Dedicated Tester Panel & Role
What it is: A new Tester role has been added. Users with this role see a dedicated "Tester Panel" with an admin-like sidebar, a dashboard with bug submission stats, a sortable list of their submitted reports, and a specialized reporting modal.
Why it matters: Provides a centralized space for QA, enabling more effective testing and feedback cycles without cluttering other user interfaces.
Affected Files:
Backend: src/common/enums/role.enum.ts
Frontend: app/(routes)/home/body.tsx, all files in app/(routes)/home/user/tester/, components/modals/BugReportModal.tsx, components/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
