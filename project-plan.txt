Project Status, Changelog & Plan (As of July 17, 2025)
Here is the comprehensive status update, incorporating the Vercel logs and our entire conversation.
‚úÖ Done in this Session: New Upload Architecture
New Frontend UI: Implemented a new attachment UI in the ticket conversation page ([ticketId]/page.tsx). It uses simple buttons to toggle between "From Device" and "From URL" upload methods, avoiding complex components.
"Upload from URL" Feature: Successfully created a new backend endpoint (/media/from-url) that fetches a file from a public link, uploads it to your Vercel Blob storage, and saves its metadata to MongoDB. This feature is confirmed working.
New Backend Webhook Architecture: Rerouted the responsibility for saving file metadata from the frontend to a secure backend webhook (/api/uploadthing in cirql-backend). This is a more robust and secure architecture.
üö® Unresolved Issues & Blockers
This is the most critical section. The following issues are preventing a successful build and test cycle.
cirql-backend Build is Failing (BLOCKER): The Vercel deployment log shows a complete build failure due to a large number of TypeScript errors. This is the highest priority and blocks all other work.
Stale/Incorrect Controller Code: The log shows errors in upload.controller.ts that indicate the wrong code is being used (e.g., req.headers, res.status). This file needs to be replaced with the correct NestJS-specific version.
Obsolete upload.router.ts: The build is still trying to compile upload.router.ts. This file should be deleted, and all references to it must be removed from upload.module.ts.
Widespread Mongoose Errors (TS2554): The build log shows a repeating error (Expected 0 arguments, but got 1) across nearly every service (settings, social, notifications, activity, support). This is a systemic issue, likely from a Mongoose version update that changed how methods are called.
ObjectId Comparison Error (TS2339): The support.service.ts is using .equals() to compare ObjectIds, which is no longer a valid method in the current Mongoose version.
Local Webhook Connection Failure: The frontend logs show Failed to simulate callback for file. This is happening because the UploadThing dev server (on https->localhost:3000) cannot establish a trusted SSL connection with your local backend server (https->localhost:3001). This prevents local uploads from being saved to the database.
üìù Immediate To-Do List (High Priority)
This is the action plan for our next session.
Fix the cirql-backend Build (BLOCKER):
Goal: Get the backend to build successfully on Vercel without any errors.
Plan:
Delete upload.router.ts from the cirql-backend/src/upload directory.
Update upload.module.ts to remove any imports or references to upload.router.ts.
Fix support.service.ts: Replace all instances of id1.equals(id2) with a string comparison: id1.toString() === id2.toString().
Fix Systemic TS2554 Error: Methodically go through every service file mentioned in the build log (settings.service.ts, social.service.ts, etc.) and refactor the failing Mongoose calls from a callback pattern (which is what the error implies) to use modern async/await.
Fix Local Webhook Connection:
Goal: Allow local file uploads to be successfully saved to the database during local development.
Plan: Implement the NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED fix in cirql-backend/main.ts. This is the standard, secure way to solve localhost-to-localhost SSL issues without compromising your code structure.
üö´ What NOT To Do (Constraints & Learnings)
To make our next session more efficient, we will adhere to the following constraints:
Do NOT Downgrade to http: We will maintain the https setup for local development to ensure it mirrors the production environment.
Do NOT Introduce New UI Components: We will not use Popover, ToggleGroup, or other complex components unless you specifically ask for them. We will build UIs with the basic, known components from your existing ShadCN setup (Button, Input, Label, etc.).
üöÄ Future Plans (Post-Fixes)
Once the blockers are resolved, we can finally proceed with testing and deploying the complete, robust upload system we've designed. The architecture is sound; we just need to resolve these critical build and environment issues.
