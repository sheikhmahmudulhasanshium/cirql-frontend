Changelog - v1.2.2 (July 3, 2025)
This is a user experience and stability update. We've introduced a highly requested personalization feature, improved UI consistency across the platform, and fixed a critical bug that was affecting user sessions.
‚ú® New Features
Your Dates, Your Way: Customizable Date & Time Formats
What it is: Users can now visit their Settings page and choose exactly how they want dates and times to be displayed.
Why it matters: This makes the platform feel more personal and intuitive, catering to international users and individual preferences. Whether you prefer July 2, 2024 or 02/07/2024, the choice is now yours.
Details:
A new "Date & Time" section is now available in Settings.
Options are available for Short Dates, Long Dates, and Time (12-hour vs. 24-hour).
Your chosen format will now appear everywhere, from notification timestamps to announcement creation dates.
üõ†Ô∏è Improvements & Refinements
Smarter Timestamps (Relative Time)
What it is: Instead of showing a full date for a recent event, the UI will now use relative terms like "5 minutes ago" or "2 hours ago".
Why it matters: This provides a much quicker sense of when something happened. For the exact date, users can simply hover their mouse over the relative time.
Consistent Pagination Controls
What it is: We've standardized the page navigation controls across all feeds (like Notifications and Announcements).
Why it matters: The old, complex page links (< 1 ... 4 5 6 ... 10 >) have been replaced with a simple and clear Previous | Page X of Y | Next style, making navigation easier and more predictable.
Centralized Date Logic (Technical Improvement)
What it is: We built a single, reliable "date formatting engine" that all parts of the app now use.
Why it matters: This internal refactor makes the app easier to maintain and ensures that all dates are handled consistently, reducing the chance of future bugs.
üêõ Bug Fixes
Critical Authentication Fix
The Bug: After logging in, users were being treated as "logged out" by the server on subsequent page loads, leading to widespread errors and an inability to access protected content.
The Fix: We identified and fixed the issue where the user's login session (authentication token) was not being correctly saved in the browser. The login and logout processes are now robust and reliable.
Impact: This resolves all 401 Unauthorized errors and ensures a stable, uninterrupted user session.
üìù What's Next (To-Do)
Cloud-Based File & Image Handling
Goal: Allow users to upload files like profile pictures, with automatic optimization and fast delivery.
Plan:
Integrate cloudflare/upload-thing into our NestJS backend to handle secure file uploads.
Files will be stored on a cloud service like Cloudflare R2.
The service will automatically handle resizing, compression, and format conversion (e.g., to WebP).
A free CDN (Cloudflare) will be used to serve the optimized images, ensuring fast load times for users globally and reducing bandwidth costs on our Vercel hosting.
In-App Surveys & Feedback System
Goal: Create a simple and effective way to gather user feedback, vote on new features, and report bugs without leaving the app.
Plan:
Integrate Google Forms directly into the frontend.
We will create specific forms for "System Review," "Feature Polls," and "Bug Reports."
These forms will be embedded within dedicated pages or modals in the app, providing a seamless experience for the user and an easy way for the admin team to collect and analyze data.
